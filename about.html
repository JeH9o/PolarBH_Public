        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
            I’m Manwai — a web developer who loves cyberpunk aesthetics, neon atmospheres,
            and building modular, scalable front‑end systems.  
            This site is my playground where I experiment with design, animation,
            and futuristic UI concepts inspired by games like <strong>STRAY</strong>.

        <h2>Who I Am</h2>
        <p>
            I’m a creative developer who enjoys turning ideas into interactive experiences.
            I love clean architecture, modular JavaScript, and building components that feel alive.
            My work blends technology with style — especially neon, dark themes, and atmospheric visuals.

        <h2>My Philosophy</h2>
        <p>
            I believe websites should feel like worlds — not just pages.  
            Every animation, color, and interaction should tell a story.  
            STRAY’s atmosphere inspires me to create interfaces that feel alive,
            immersive, and emotionally expressive.

        <h2>What I’m Building Next</h2>
        <p>
            I’m currently expanding this site into a full cyberpunk‑inspired portfolio,
            complete with animated UI, neon effects, and a dynamic blog system.
            My goal is to create a space that feels like stepping into a neon alleyway
            in a futuristic city — quiet, atmospheric, and full of personality.
